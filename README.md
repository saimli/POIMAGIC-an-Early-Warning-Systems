# POIMAGIC-an-Early-Warning-Systems
The goal of the project is to create an Early Warning System called POIMAGIC for streaming spatial events based on Earthquake hotspots. The total data in each dataset will be subdivided into 12 batches which contain the locations of events for a time interval of 2 months; e.g. one batch might contain the locations of earthquakes which happened in September till October of 2020 and our system will use a sliding window approach to create input data for the POIMAGIC system.
